We tried Tcf1 ChIPseq using WT CD4 cells and Tcf1 KO CD4 cells as negative control. This antibody is a new one we made in the lab. You can use the same condition to call peaks to see if this set of data is any good. 
We also tested Lef1 in WT CD4, and Lef1 KO as negative control. The same strategy to see if this set data are improved. 

Sample info:

LEF1-CD4	A8	ACTTGATG
LEF1-LKO	B11	GTGCTACC
TCF1-CD4	D10	TCAGATTC
TCF1-TKO	D7	TCATTGAG

There are 4 other samples. 
This is the follow up of our NI paper, where we show increased H3K27Ac in the Tcf1 and Lef1 KO, when both factors were deleted during CD8 T cell development. 
Here we delete both factors in mature T cells to see if H3K27Ac was still increased. 
This is related to a question about "establishing T cell identity" and "maintaining T cell identity". 
Please download the data for now, and we will discuss how to use this.
