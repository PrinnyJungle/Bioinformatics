To create a bigWig track from a wiggle file, follow these steps:
Create a wig format file following the directions here. Note that when converting a wig file to a bigWig file, you are limited to one track of data in your input file; you must create a separate wig file for each data track. Note that this is the file that is referred to as input.wig in step 5 below.
Remove any existing 'track' or 'browser' lines from your wig file so that it contains only data.
Download the wigToBigWig program from the directory of binary utilities.
Use the fetchChromSizes script from the same directory to create the chrom.sizes file for the UCSC database you are working with (e.g. hg19). Note that this is the file that is referred to as chrom.sizes in step 5 below.
Create the bigWig file from your wig file using the wigToBigWig utility like so: wigToBigWig input.wig chrom.sizes myBigWig.bw
(Note that the wigToBigWig program also accepts a gzipped wig input file.)
Move the newly created bigWig file (myBigWig.bw) to a http, https, or ftp location.
Construct a custom track using a single track line. Note that any of the track attributes listed on the wiggle track format page are applicable to tracks of type bigWig. The most basic version of the "track" line will look something like this:
track type=bigWig name="My Big Wig" description="A Graph of Data from My Lab" bigDataUrl=http://myorg.edu/mylab/myBigWig.bw
Paste this custom track line into the text box in the custom track management page.
